# Hi, I'm Dola Pavan Kumar 👋

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **Computer Science graduate student** at Bradley University (graduating Dec 2026) with a passion for **building distributed systems from scratch** to understand how things actually work under the hood.

I learn by doing — whether it's implementing distributed transactions with the Saga pattern, building an LRU cache with O(1) operations, or constructing an HTTP server from TCP sockets. My approach: just enough theory, then build.

**Currently seeking Summer 2026 Software Engineering internships** in backend infrastructure, distributed systems, or cloud-native applications.

## 💻 What I'm Building

🔧 **Distributed Systems**
- Banking microservices with Saga pattern & 2PC for distributed transactions
- Key-value store with Write-Ahead Logging and crash recovery
- LRU cache with thread-safe eviction and persistence
- Message queue broker with Kafka-like semantics *(in progress)*

☁️ **Cloud-Native Applications**
- Order management system on AWS EKS with RDS migration
- CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and Docker optimization
- Observability with Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki

🛠️ **From-Scratch Implementations**
- HTTP web server built on raw TCP sockets
- Custom database with compaction and thread-safe operations

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Languages:** Java, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, C/C++, SQL

**Backend:** Spring Boot, Hibernate, JDBC, Kafka

**Frontend:** React.js, TypeScript

**Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis

**DevOps & Cloud:** Docker, Kubernetes, AWS (EKS, ECR, RDS), GitHub Actions

**Observability:** Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Promtail
